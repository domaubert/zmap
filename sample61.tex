%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.1 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and
%% other external packages (latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf).
%% All of these external packages should already be present in the modern TeX 
%% distributions.  If not they can also be obtained at www.ctan.org.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style  which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%%
%% using aastex version 6.1
\documentclass[twocolumn]{aastex61}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be envoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[argument]{aastex61}
%% 
%% where the arguement options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can envoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%  astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%  tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                 the twocolumn substyle.
%%  times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%  linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%  trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%  longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                 the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                 affiliation information after each name. Creates a much
%%                 long author list but may be desirable for short author papers
%%
%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex61}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.1 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affilations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% autoindexing of affilations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% arguement which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.1 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.1 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to

%\begin{abstract}
%The Reionization as experienced by galaxies is a diverse and heterogeneous process. We probe this diversity by presenting predictions of the Reionization times of z=0 galaxies, made using simulations. The  $z>6$  epoch is described using the CODA~I-AMR radiative hydrodynamics simulation produced with the EMMA code.
%%that models self-consistently the evolution of the gas ionisation state until the end of the first billion years of the Universe. This simulation has been 
%%produced with the AMR code EMMA %and deployed on 32768 CPU cores and 4096 GPUs on Titan. 
%High-redshift predictions are projected 13 billions years later using a pure dark matter Gadget simulation with the same set of CLUES initial conditions that include a Local Group analog. In both cases the $(64 \mathrm{Mpc/h})^3$ volume is sampled with 8 billions initial resolution elements,  allowing to probe z=0 halos in the $10^8-10^{13} M_\odot$ range. 
%
%We find that current galaxies with $M_{z=0}>10^{11} M_\odot$ were on average  reionized up to $\sim 500$ millions years earlier than the Universe as a whole.
%%\since the progenitors of these objects form in the high peaks of the density field
%%resulting from these objects being the hosts of the first sources. 
%The scatter in Reionization times can be significant and Milky-Way like galaxies can have $z>6$ progenitors reionized as early as z=15 and as late as z=8. Less massive objects ($<10^{11} M_\odot$) are typically reionized at the same time as the overall volume or even later : this lag can be attributed to dark objects that require external radiation to complete their reionization. Measures of the reionization durations within halos show that the time required to reionize galaxies can be as large as the halo-to-halo fluctuations of reionization times. 
%
%Finally, we find that the Local Group was not influenced by an external sweeping ionization front. The Milky Way and M31 analogs of our simulation reionized respectively at z=9.8 and z=11, without influencing each other.
%\end{abstract}


%\begin{abstract}
%The progenitors of today’s galaxies experienced cosmic reionization at different times in different parts of the universe, since reionization was inhomogeneous in time and space.  The common assumption that reionization occurred in the neighborhood of these galaxies at the same universal redshift for all galaxies is re-examined here.  We match present-day galaxies with the reionization redshifts of the intergalactic medium at the locations of their progenitors by combining the results of a new, fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of galaxy formation and reionization to redshift 6 with an N-body simulation to the present from the same initial conditions. These initial conditions were pre-selected to form the well-known structures of the local universe, including the Local Group and the Virgo cluster, in a (91 Mpc)$^3$ volume, large enough to model both global reionization and its local history.  The reionization simulation, CoDa I-AMR, by a new, hybrid CPU-GPU code EMMA used (2048)$^3$ dark matter particles and (2048)$^3$ initial cells, adaptively-refined, while the N-body simulation, CoDa I-DM2048,  by Gadget2 used (2048)$^3$ particles, allowing us to study the reionization times of all the galaxies in this volume at z = 0 in the mass range from $10^8$ to $10^13 M_\odot$.  
%
%	The progenitors of galaxies more massive than $\sim 10^11 M_\odot$ today were found to reionize earlier than the universe as a whole, by as much as ~ 500 Myrs.  The scatter in this reionization time was significant. The progenitors of Milky-Way-like galaxies, for example, showed reionization redshifts that range from z = 8 to z = 15, while the global (mean) reionization redshift was $\langle z_reion\rangle$ = 6 (??).  For galaxies less massive than $10^11 M_\odot$ today, however, progenitors typically reionized as late or even later than the global reionization time, corresponding to neighborhoods in which reionization was completed by external radiation from more distant sources.  The duration of the reionization transition in a progenitor’s neighborhood was also found to be substantial, as large as the range of reionization times for different galaxies.  As for the Local Group, the progenitors of the Milky Way and M31 both reionized before the global reionization redshift; two methods used to determine their reionization redshifts yield different answers,  z = 9.8 (MW) and 11 (M31) or z = 8.2 (both), and neither reionization was dominated by external radiation.

\begin{abstract}
Today’s galaxies experienced cosmic reionization at different times in different locations, since reionization was inhomogeneous. We show this by deriving the reionization ($50\%$ ionized) redshifts, $z_R$, of the intergalactic medium surrounding their progenitors, using fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of galaxy formation and reionization at $z > 6$, matched to N-body simulation to z = 0. Constrained initial conditions were chosen to form the well-known structures of the local universe, including the Local Group and Virgo,
in a (91 Mpc)$^3$ volume large enough to model both global and local reionization. Reionization simulation CoDa I-AMR, by hybrid CPU-GPU code EMMA, used (2048)$^3$ particles and (2048)$^3$ initial cells, adaptively-refined, while N-body simulation CoDa I-DM2048, by Gadget2, used (2048)$^3$ particles, to find these reionization times for all galaxies at z = 0 with $M\ge 10^8 M_\odot$. 
Galaxies with $M(z=0) \gtrsim 10^{11} M_\odot$ reionized earlier than the universe as a whole, by up to $\sim$ 500 Myrs, with significant scatter. For Milky-Way-like galaxies, $z_R$ ranged from 8 to 15. Galaxies with $M(z=0) \lesssim 10^{11} M_\odot$ typically reionized as late or even later than global reionization at z=7.8, in neighborhoods where reionization was completed by external radiation. The duration of reionization was sometimes substantial, ranging as large as the range of reionization times. The Milky Way and M31 reionized earlier than global reionization, neither dominated by external radiation. Tracking their progenitors using either halos or particles yielded $z_R = 9.8$ (MW) and 11 (M31) or $z_R = 8.2$ (both), respectively.

\section{Introduction}
The emergent UV radiation field during the epoch of reionization (EOR) set the thermal and ionisation state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). It also suppressed baryonic infall and star formation in low-mass galaxies, through photoheating, especially for objects below $10^9 M_\odot$, limiting their contribution to reionization and causing reionization to self-regulate (e.g. \citet{SGB94}, \citet{ILIEV07}). Accordingly, reconstructed star formation histories of the faintest dwarf galaxies indicate that reionization slowed their stellar population build-up (see e.g. \citet{BROWN14}). Recent large-volume, high-resolution, radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations of reionization also reproduce this suppression \citep{OCV16}. 

Reionization was neither uniform nor instantaneous: large-scale structure created an inhomogeneous distribution of sources and absorbers. Different patches of the universe reionized at different times, over a wide range of redshifts. 
%For instance, Ly-$\alpha$ forest data suggest that the spatial fluctuations of the UV field remain important even after the overlap, possibly originating in the density field (e.g. \citet{DAV16}), temperature fluctuations (e.g. \citet{ALO15}) or the presence of bright UV sources (e.g. \citet{CHA15}).

This local reionization time left its imprint on galaxies at $z = 0$.
The stellar populations of their satellites, for example, were dramatically affected by when reionization occurred and whether instantaneous or extended (see e.g.
\citet{KOP9,BUS10,OCV11,ILI11,OCV14,GIL15}).
%Koposov et al. 2009; Busha et al. 2010, Ocvirk \& Aubert, 2011, Iliev et al. 2011, Ocvirk et al. 2014, Gillet et al. 2015). 
Reionization suppression is thought to reconcile the observed paucity of satellites in the Local Group (LG) with their over-prediction by N-body simulations of $\Lambda$CDM. In a global context, where the contribution of low-mass galaxies to reionization is still debated (see e.g. \citet{BOU14,FIN15}), these effects must be understood in order to interpret observations of high-z galaxies. 

We have modelled the inhomogeneous timing and duration of reionization as experienced by today's galaxies. The main challenge is to connect these objects to their progenitors during the EOR at $z > 6$, 13 billion years ago, by tracing their complicated mass-assembly histories to find the reionization histories of those progenitors. 
We combine for the first time a new, state-of-the-art, fully-coupled RHD simulation of galaxy formation and reionization at $z > 6$, with a dark-matter-only N-body simulation to $z = 0$, 
from the same initial conditions (ICs), to match galaxies at $z = 0$ with their reionization pasts self-consistently.
Reionization simulation CoDa I-AMR ("Cosmic Dawn"), by hybrid CPU-GPU AMR code EMMA, used (2048)$^3$ particles and (2048)$^3$ initial cells, while N-body simulation CoDa I-DM2048, by Gadget2, used (2048)$^3$ particles, to find reionization times and durations for the galaxies in that volume at z = 0 with  $M\ge 10^8 M_\odot$. 

 These ICs are a constrained realization of $\Lambda$CDM, constructed by the CLUEs ("Constrained Local UniversE Simulations") project from observations of galaxies in the local universe, to form familiar structures within it, including the LG with the Milky Way (MW) and M31 in a (91 Mpc)$^3$ volume large enough to model both global and local reionization. 
 These ICs enable us to model the reionization history
 %, not merely of randomly-selected "LG analogs" in a random realization, but 
 of the LG in its authentic environment, to assess how representative it is, as the most accessible place to observe galaxies and their satellites today to deduce their histories.  


%In the current letter, we explore the timings of the Reionization of $z = 0$ galaxies using a EMMA radiative hydrodynamics simulation of the Reionization \citep{AUB15} and extrapolating $z>6$ properties to $z=0$ using a pure DM Gadget simulation that shares the same initial conditions. We focus on the time and duration of the Reionization and we investigate briefly the impact of cosmic variance. 

The work presented here succeeds previous studies made by, e.g. \citet{WEI07} or \citet{DIX17}, who used radiative transfer to post-process pure N-body simulations. It also complements \citet{ALV9} and \citet{LI14}, who focused on scales relevant to massive galaxies and clusters, using semi-numerical methodology. Thanks to the range of scales 
explored here (91 Mpc box-size sampled at kpc resolution), we are able to focus on smaller-mass objects between $10^8 M_\odot$ and $10^{13} M_\odot$. 
Our approach to matching present-day galaxies to their reionization past is similar to that in \citet{OCV14} on reionization of the LG. %, alone, which used radiative transfer to post-process an N-body/SPH zoom-in simulation of the LG, from CLUEs ICs. 
Here we model the EOR over the entire large-scale environment beyond the LG and compare the LG to the full population of galaxies. In addition, we simulate the EOR with fully-coupled RHD.  The CoDa I-AMR simulation introduced here is a successor to simulation CoDa I of \citep{OCV16}. %, the first simulation of galaxy formation and reionization of the local universe with fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamics, from the same ICs in the same volume as here, by hybrid GPU-CPU code Ramses-Cudaton, using $4096^3$ particles and a uniform grid of $4096^3$ cells.  
CoDa I-AMR has lower particle-mass resolution than CoDa I, but AMR makes its gravity length resolution comparable or better and compensates for the different initial grid-resolution of gas and radiation, while its star formation efficiency was re-calibrated to finish gobal reionization earlier, by $z = 6.1$.   

We describe our simulations below and their analysis. 
We then present the reionization times and durations of our simulated population of galaxies, before discussing the LG. 

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Initial Conditions}

The CLUES constrained-realization ICs used here assume a WMAP 5 cosmology ($\Omega_m=0.279, \Omega_v=0.721, H_0=70$ km/s/Mpc, \citet{HIN9}) in a (91 Mpc)$^3$%  [i.e. (64 Mpc/h)$^3$] 
comoving volume with $2048^3$ particles and cells. These ICs are a coarsened version of those in the CODA I simulation \citep{OCV16}. Initial phases were chosen to reproduce the observed structures of the local universe at z=0, providing an MW - M31 pair with the right mass range and separation in the proper large-scale environment (see \citet{GOT10}, \citet{ILI11}, \citet{FR11}). 
% and were chosen for future comparisons.

%choices were motivated by future comparisons with the CODA I simulation \citep{OCV16} which used the same initial conditions. They cover a $91$ Mpc/h comoving volume with $2048^3$ grid cells and particles.  The initial phases were chosen to produce an analog of the Local Universe at z=0 (see \citet{GOT10},\citet{ILI11}) providing a Milky Way (MW)- M31 pair with the right mass range and separation in the proper large scale environment. These choices were motivated by future comparisons with the CODA I simulation \citep{OCV16} which used the same initial conditions.

%The CLUES constrained-realization ICs used here are the same as for simulation 
%CoDa I in \citet{OCV16}, where they are described in more detail, but
%coarsened here to $2048^3$, as for N-body simulation 
%DM2048 described there in Appendix A.  They assume WMAP 5 cosmology ($\Omega_m=0.279, %\Omega_v=0.721, H_0=70$ km/s/Mpc, \citet{HIN9}), in a
%(91 Mpc)$^3$  [i.e. (64 Mpc/h)$^3$] comoving volume with $2048^3$ particles and cells. Initial phases were chosen to reproduce the observed structures of the local universe at z=0, providing an MW - M31 pair with the right mass range and separation in the proper large-scale environment 
%. 


\subsection{Reionization Simulation to $z = 6$}
EOR simulation CoDa I-AMR to $z = 6$, by hybrid CPU-GPU, AMR code EMMA \citep{AUB15}, solved fully-coupled equations of collisionless DM dynamics, hydrodynamics and radiative transfer, with standard sub-grid models for star formation and supernova feedback (\citet{RAS06}, \citet{DEP17}). 
The initial spatial grid of $2048^3$ cells was refined whenever a cell contained more than 8 DM particles, until cell-widths reached 500 pc (proper), corresponding to three refinement levels by z=6, increasing total cell number by 2.1, to 18 billion.   CoDa I-AMR was produced on Titan (ORNL) using 32768 CPU cores and 4096 GPUs dedicated to RHD solvers.

Star formation was triggered if gas overdensity in a cell exceeded 50, resulting in first star particles at $z\sim 19$; once triggered, star formation obeyed a Schmidt-Kenicutt Law with efficiency $1\%$ (see \citet{RAS06}, \citet{DEP17}). Star-particles, of mass  $7\times 10^4 M_\odot$, released ionizing photons according to a Starburst 99 population model \citep{LEI99} with Top-Heavy IMF and 0.05 $Z_\odot$ metallicity; the corresponding emissivity was $1.5\times 10^{17}$ ionising photons/sec/stellar kg for $3\times 10^6$ years, followed by exponential decline. A sugrid escape fraction $0.2$ was applied to compute the photon number released inside the star-particle's cell.  
This ensured that global reionization finished at $z\sim 6$.  

\dom{Radiative transfer was moment-based, with M1 closure and a reduced speed of light $c_\mathrm{sim}=0.1$}. Mechanical feedback from supernovae was included, with energy $9.8\times 10^{11}$ J/stellar kg injected into
surrounding gas after $15\times 10^6$ years: 1/3 via thermal energy, 2/3 via kinetic winds. At z=6, $120\times 10^6$ star-particles were present.

%CODA I-AMR used 32,768 CPUs and 4096 GPUs on the TITAN  supercomputer at ORNL/DOE. The EMMA code uses GPUs to accelerate the hydrodynamics and radiative transfer: these modules are 25 and 15 times faster, respectively, on the GPU than on a single CPU core. %Provided that each GPU is shared by 8 cores and that a substantial part of EMMA is exclusively managed by CPUs, the addition of 4096 GPUs to the 32768 cores leads to an 1.5 acceleration factor. 

%Finally, this simulation results from the conversion of a qualification run into a production one : it used a reduced speed of light ($c_\mathrm{sim}=0.1c$) that has been kept for the final run.

Global reionization in CODA I-AMR finished by $z=6.1$, with a reionization epoch consistent with CMB constraints \citep{PLA15} but with a residual neutral fraction somewhat lower than expected from quasar data (\citet{FAN6}, see Fig. \ref{fig:globpro}). The average star formation history was consistent with that inferred from observations of the UV luminosity function of high-z galaxies \citep{BOU14,FIN15}.

\subsection{Dark-Matter-Only Simulation to $z = 0$}

The properties of z=0 halos were obtained from a dark-matter-only N-body simulation, CoDa I-DM2048, by Gadget2 \citep{SPR5}, from the same ICs as CoDa I-AMR, presented as simulation DM2048 in \citet{OCV16}. %The mass resolution is identical to the radiative hydrodynamics simulation with a smoothing length corresponding to $1/20$ of the mean interparticle distance. 
Halos were identified using a FOF algorithm with linking length 0.2 and a minimum number of particles of 10, leading to $\sim 20$ million halos identified at z=0. The smallest-mass FOF objects detected had $2.4\times 10^7 M_\odot$. Merger trees were also generated to connect z=0 halos to their progenitors during the EoR \citep{RIE13}. 
%These $z\gg 0$ progenitors do not necessarily exist and only the most massive z=0 halos have a progenitor identified $13\times 10^9$ years earlier : $10^6$  z=0 objects have an identified progenitor at z=6. Alternatively, all z=0 halos can be traced back to the Reionization using their particles which are uniquely identified.

\subsection{Reionization maps}
A 3-D map of reionization times (and redshifts) was created from the evolving, inhomogeneous, nonequilibrium ionization state of hydrogen in CoDa I-AMR.  We define the reionization time as the instant when a cell first crossed the ionized-fraction threshold 0.5.  
The result is a 3-D field, $t_\mathrm{reion}(x,y,z)$, sampled using $2048^3$ pixels corresponding to the base resolution of our simulation (see Fig. \ref{fig:reion_halo_map}). 
There is a clear correlation between the CoDa I-DM2048 halo distribution at z=6 and the CODA I-AMR reionization map : \dom{halos are found at the centers of ionized patches and their spatial distribution matches the topology of $t_\mathrm{reion}(x,y,z)$}.

This map was computed on-the-fly by EMMA with a time resolution driven by hydrodynamical processes. However, due to memory management issues, this procedure was stopped at $z = 8$, and, thereafter, reionization times were computed from stored snapshots of later time-slices. At its worst, time resolution was 1.4 Myrs at $z = 6$.

Cell-based reionization times do not distinguish cells inside galactic halos from intergalactic cells.  It is the IGM, however, which undergoes reionization, while interstellar gas inside galaxies may remain neutral even after global reionization ends.  It is, therefore, the reionization time of the IGM at the locations of the progenitor halos or particles we seek, specifically the times at which these locations first reached ionized fraction 0.5.  Henceforth, this is what we shall mean when we assign a 'galaxy reionization time' $t_\mathrm{reion}$ to a $z = 0$ galaxy.

\subsection{Progenitor-based Reionization Times }
We start by assigning reionization times to $z = 0$ galaxies using those of their progenitor halos, using the merger-trees of the DM-only simulation to determine the positions, $ \vec x_\mathrm{mm}$, at each $z > 6$, of their most-massive (mm) progenitors. Starting from $z = 20$, we find the earliest step in the merger tree when the most massive progenitor at that step belongs to an ionized cell. This step has redshift $z_R$, and the reionization time of a $z = 0$ halo is given by
\begin{equation}
t_\mathrm{prog}=t_\mathrm{reion}(\vec x_\mathrm{mmR}),
\end{equation}
where $\vec x_\mathrm{mmR}$ is the center-of-mass position of the most massive progenitor of this halo at $z=z_R$.
 %(see Fig. \ref{fig:methods})
%: $z_R$ stands for the highest redshift in the merger tree when $\vec x_\mathrm{mm}$ lies within an ionized cell in the reionization map.
%The interpolation from the progenitor position to the $t_\mathrm{reion}$ cartesian cells positions is performed using a simple nearest-grid point technique.

%The merger-trees and the 3D field reionization time being available, $t_\mathrm{reion}$ is easily obtained. 
%However it implies that 
A halo is assigned a reionization time only if it has a progenitor at $z > 6$; this is not the case if progenitor halos only emerged after $z = 6$ or were not detected by the FOF algorithm before this. %It's the case $\sim 10^8 M_\odot$ halos with only a few particles. 
However, this procedure guarantees that $t_\mathrm{prog}$ is set by material already in the structure by $z > 6$. 

%Given our resolution, we cannot guarantee that a galaxy is fully reionized as some regions may be self-shielded at small scales : these 'galaxy reionization' times should rather be understood as the reionization times of 'galactic environment'.
% and is not too much diluted by matter added during the next 13 billions years.

\subsection{Particle-based Reionization Times}
Our second approach is based upon the reionization times of all the DM particles that belong to a halo at $z = 0$.
 %(see Fig. \ref{fig:methods}.)
 Once these particles are identified, their positions at $z > 6$ can be traced using simulation snaphots. Each particle is then assigned a reionization time defined as the earliest time $t(z_R)$ it was located inside an ionized cell in the reionization map. An average particle-based $\langle t_\mathrm{part} \rangle$ 
 is then assigned to each halo:
\begin{equation}
\langle t_\mathrm{part}\rangle=\frac{\sum_{\vec x_\mathrm{p0} \in \mathrm{halo} \ } t_\mathrm{reion}(\vec x_\mathrm{pR})}{\sum_{\vec x_\mathrm{p0} \in \mathrm{halo} \ } 1},
\end{equation}
where $\vec x_\mathrm{p0}$ and $\vec x_\mathrm{pR}$ are 
particle positions at $z = 0$ and $z = z_R$, respectively.

This procedure is more difficult, as it requires cross-matching $8\times 10^9$ DM particles with $\sim 20\times 10^6$ $z = 0$ halos to identify the particles belonging to each halo. 
%Once this membership is obtained, particles must be recovered in z=6 snaphots and being assigned a reionization redshift from $t_\mathrm{reion}$ using the same nearest-grid point technique used for progenitor-based prediction.
However, this technique has the advantage that it assigns reionization times to all $z = 0$ halos, even the smallest. Reionization times determined this way tend to be later than those by the other method since diffuse material, presumably reionized at later times and/or accreted after reionization, is included.

\end{figure}

Reionization times of z=0 halos are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:treion}. Galaxies with $M_{z=0}>10^{11} h^{-1}M_\odot$ reionized up to $500$ Myrs earlier than the full volume, depending on the method used. In this mass range, the more massive the galaxies, the earlier they reionized, as expected since their progenitors were located in denser environments where more intense sources formed. For lower masses, ($M_{z=0}<10^{11} h^{-1}M_\odot$), reionization times were typically consistent with the global one.  Their median time was slightly later than the global time : these objects were fainter or even star-less and were externally reionized. Since their immediate environment was denser than the average IGM, they ionized later than the IGM.  Nevertheless, halo-to-halo scatter is significant ($\sim 250$ Myrs $5\%-95\%$ percentile).

Results for the two methods are consistent but different. The progenitor-based technique applies only to objects already formed at high z : it finds the reionization redshift of the oldest material of a z=0 halo, thus explaining why it consistently yields lower $t_\mathrm{reion}$. On the other hand, it requires that FOF objects pre-existed at $z>6$, biasing the halo sample:  $10^8 h^{-1} M_\odot$ halos at z=0  must have had peculiar accretion rates to have progenitors at $z>6$ and low mass at z=0. The dip in reionization times at the low-mass end confirms this, and our results indicate these objects are located in high-density regions, thus explaining their low $t_\mathrm{reion}$. It may also indicate these objects were more massive in the past and were stripped : these low-mass objects were assigned $t_\mathrm{reion}$ typical of more massive objects.

The particle-based method suffers less from this bias because all z=0 halos are included~: the $t_\mathrm{reion}$ dip at the low-mass end disappears. It returns lower reionization redshifts for $M_{z=0}>10^{11} M_\odot$, resulting from the fraction of material in halos at z=0 that was diffuse matter in the IGM and reionized at later times.

\citet{LI14} found that $10^{12} h^{-1} M_\odot$ galaxies tend to reionize earlier than the IGM, by $\Delta z\sim 1\pm1$, while we find earlier reionization times for these objects, too, but by $\Delta z\sim 1.5\pm 1.5$ (particle-based) or $\Delta z\sim 4.5\pm 3$ (progenitor-based). The difference may be related to methodologies (excursion set formalism against fully coupled RHD here) or earlier reionization histories driven by brighter sources (global 0.5 reionization redshifts $z_R\sim 11$ instead of 7.8 here) yielding smaller lags between galaxies and the  IGM.

 %They assign reionization times using halo positions at $z = 0$, for example, while we use progenitor or particle positions at $z > 6$. Their approximation may be appropriate for halo masses above $10^{13} M_\odot$, but for lower-mass objects, we find that positions at $z = 0$ poorly approximate progenitor and particle positions at high z. 
%That their reionization times are closer to the global mean may indicate 'signal dilution' at the lower-end of their probed range of halo mass. 
%On the other hand, our initial conditions were designed to include large clusters in a relatively small volume : it could lead to an overestimate of the UV-background 
%(as hinted by the low residual neutral fraction at z=6) 
%and an onset of the Reionization at earlier times than in their more representative large volumes. 
%The relative role played by these opposite effects is not clear yet.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item  Galaxies with $M>10^{12} M_\odot$ tend to reionize earlier than the full volume:$\sim 150-250$ myrs earlier. In this mass range, the more massive the galaxies, the earlier they are reionize as expected since they should host the most intense sources or be close to them in dense environments.
%\item At the low-mass end ($M<10^{12} M_\odot$) the reionization time becomes consistent with the global reionization time.  Note that the median time is slightly higher than the global one : it could indicate that among this population there are objects that are very faint or even without stars and must be externally reionized. Being denser, it takes more time to reionize them than in takes for the IGM.  That being said, the scatter is quite significant from to halo to halo ($\sim 120$ Myrs).
%\item Note that the two methodologies given consistent results but with slight differences. The progenitor-based technique (red curves) guarantees that an object is already formed at high z : it returns the reionization redshift of the oldest material of a z=0 halo, thus explaining why it consistently returns lower $t_\mathrm{reion}$. On the other hand since it requires that objects pre-exist at z=6, it biases the sample of halos: for instance a $10^8 M_\odot$ halo at z=0  must be quite peculiar to already have a progenitor at $z=6$ and be very light at z=0. Clearly the dip in reionization times at the low mass end confirms this. Just by eye inspections, these objects are located in high-density regions, thus explaining their lower $t_\mathrm{reion}$. It could also indicate that these objects were more massive in the past and were disrupted : these low-mass objects are being assigned $t_\mathrm{reion}$ typical of more massive objects.
%\item On the other hand, the particle-based methodology suffers less from this bias and the $t_\mathrm{reion}$ dip at the low mass end disappears. However, this method returns lower reionization redshifts and it results from the fact that a fraction, sometimes significant, of material in halos at z=0 was part of the diffuse matter and was reionized at late times.

\subsection{Reionization Durations}

%\caption{The intrinsic spread of reionization times $\Delta t$ as a function of the halo mass. The line stand for the median value within each bin of mass and the shaded area covers the $5\%-95\%$ percentiles. }
%\label{fig:dt}
%\end{figure}

The spread $\Delta t$ of reionization times $t_\mathrm{reion}$ of particles in a halo at $z = 0$ can be used to compute the duration of its reionization. The result is plotted versus halo mass in Fig. \ref{fig:treion}. $\Delta t_{2\sigma}$ is computed from the r.m.s. of particle reionization times within a halo, using $\Delta t_{2\sigma}=(\langle t_\mathrm{part}\rangle+\sigma)-(\langle t_\mathrm{part}\rangle-\sigma)$. 

$\Delta t_{2\sigma}$ increases with halo mass, with typical values of $\sim 120$ Myr for $M_{z=0}>10^{11} h^{-1} M_\odot$. For $10^{12} h^{-1} M_\odot$, reionization durations as long as 180 Myr or as short as 60 Myr can be found. \citet{OCV14} made similar determinations for subhaloes of M31-MW analogs, and our results are consistent with their SPH model with similar emissivity for sources: our 120 Myr duration is typical of their reionization in isolated models, where inside-out reionization proceeds from inner regions of a galaxy to its outskirts.  Our shortest durations, $\Delta t_{2\sigma}=60$ Myr, are, on the other hand, typical of their externally-reionized scenario, where a nearby bright source 'flashes' the object. The scatter here reflects diverse environmental properties.

For $M_{z=0}>10^{11}h^{-1} M_\odot$, typical values of $\Delta t_{2\sigma}$ are comparable to the halo-to-halo scatter of $t_\mathrm{reion}$ and are likely to be lower bounds, since self-shielding may have been underestimated at our resolution limit. This is consistent with what \citet{ALV9} and \citet{LI14} found for more massive objects. Reionization was experienced at different times for different mass elements within any given present-day galaxy. This must be taken into account by any model of the impact of reionization on stellar populations. 

At lower mass, $M_{z=0}<10^{10}h^{-1} M_\odot$, objects have $\Delta t_{2\sigma}\sim 0$. This corresponds to extreme cases of fast external reionization or objects small enough to fit within a single cell of the reionization map (from AMR data smoothed to unrefined resolution $30 h^{-1}$ comoving kpc, comparable to the virial radius of a $\sim 10^9 h^{-1} M_\odot$ halo). Scatter increases toward the low-mass end, but these objects were sampled with a small number of cells or particles (40 particles for $10^8 h^{-1} M_\odot$). Their environmental history is not as fully resolved, leading to greater errors estimating $\Delta t_{2\sigma}$.
% : as already mentioned for $t_\mathrm{reion}$ it could be due to 'stripped objects' which are being assigned $\Delta t$ typical of more massive halos. Another explanation could be tied to the small number of particles (40 for $10^8 h^{-1} M_\odot$) in such haloes, leading to greater errors in the estimate of $\sigma$.

$\Delta t_{2\sigma}$ estimates reionization durations from the spread of times for typical particles, but the full range of time differences within a halo can be even greater.
The time difference $\Delta t_\mathrm{max-min}$ between the first and the last particle to reionize is also plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:treion}. The most massive halos can have $\Delta t_\mathrm{max-min} = 600$ Myr and thus contain material from locations that reionized at very different epochs.% of the Reionization.
% (as also indicated by the difference between the progenitor and particle based estimate of $t_\mathrm{reion}$). 

Lower-mass haloes have smaller $\Delta t_\mathrm{max-min}$, with $\Delta t_\mathrm{max-min}\sim 400$ Myr for $10^{12} h^{-1}M_\odot$ but $\Delta t_\mathrm{max-min}< 100$ Myr for $M<10^{10} h^{-1} M_\odot$. For the lowest-mass galaxies, significant outliers are present, with $\Delta t_\mathrm{max-min}\sim 200$ Myr when the median value is closer to 20 Myr.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Using the particle-based method, we can investigate the intrinsic spread $\Delta t$ of $t_\mathrm{reion}$ within haloes. 
%\item $\Delta t$ increases with the halo mass with typical values of $\sim 100$ Myrs for $M>10^{11} M_\odot$ (those are z=0 masses). It's comparable with the halo to halo scatter and consistant with findings of Alvarez et al. 09 and Li et al. 2014. It's important for predictions on satellite properties for instance.
%\item At low mass end we can see that some objects have $\Delta t\sim 0$ : either these objects are 'flashed' by an external field, either they are small enough to be within a single cell of the reionization map.
%\item The dispersion increases toward the low mass end : again it could be due to 'disrupted objects' which are being assigned $\Delta t$ typical of more massive haloes.
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Local Group}

\caption{A slice thru the CoDa I-AMR reionization map around the LG (background field), with the location of CoDa I-DM2048 halo progenitors at z=10.8 for simulated M31 and MW (symbols). Symbol sizes are proportional to halo masses. Background colors indicate reionization redshift.}
\label{fig:LG}
\end{figure}

Our CLUES ICs were constructed to form a LG, with two galaxies at $z = 0$ similar to the MW ($M_{z=0}=7.7\times 10^{11} h^{-1} M_\odot$) and M31 ($M_{z=0}=1.7 \times 10^{12} h^{-1} M_\odot$) at their correct separation, surrounded by a realistic large-scale environment that matches observations of the local universe. Fig. \ref{fig:LG} shows the positions of their progenitors at z=10.8 within the reionization map. The MW environment reionized in a compact fashion. The M31 reionization pattern, on the other hand, consists of several disconnected islands, reflecting the complex and extended distribution of progenitors at these times. Both objects reionized in isolation relative to each other: their patches are easily identified and disconnected. \cite{OCV11} and \cite{GIL15} predicted that this kind of reionization should lead to a more extended radial distribution of their satellites at z=0 compared to models without radiative transfer. The LG also reionized in isolation from the large-scale environment, as no ionization fronts appeared to sweep across them from outside. 

In Fig. \ref{fig:treion}, their reionization times and durations are shown for each estimator. By the progenitor-based method, the M31 environment reionized earlier($z=11$) than for MW ($z=9.8$), consistent with the general trend whereby haloes more massive started reionization earlier. By the particle-based method, however, both objects reionized at the same time, at $z=8.2$. Since these two objects are spatially close, it is not surprising that their Lagrangian environments reionized simultaneously. For both estimators, these two galaxies are typical for their masses, albeit on the 'late reionization' side of the distribution. 

Regarding durations, $\Delta t_{2\sigma}$ are typical of the global distribution, between $100$ and $150$ Myr. $\Delta t_{\mathrm max-min} \sim 400$ Myr are similar for the two objects, indicating their environments share similar extreme values for reionization times, presumably because of their proximity. %This makes the spread of reionization times within M31 among the most compact for its mass, perhaps due to proximity of MW.
%DOMINIQUE: I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE LAST SENTENCE! Paul

These particle-based durations and times are consistent with the partially-suppressed model of \citet{DIX17}, where low-mass galaxies $M<10^9 h^{-1} M_\odot$ made a modest but 
non-negligible contribution to reionization~: it suggests a similar quantitative role for such objects in CODA I-AMR.

At the high mass end however, the opposite trend can be seen : the densest octant promotes surprisingly lower reionization redshifts. It could be a small number effect which prevent convergence of these results or due to the moderation of star formation by the brightest sources in these densest environments : the most massive and brightest sources would lower the photon production of less massive objects that provide the majority of ionizing photons.

 \section{Summary}
 
By combining a new, fully-coupled RHD simulation of reionization at $z > 6$ with an N-body simulation to $z = 0$ from the same ICs, we demonstrate that the redshifts at which present-day galaxies experienced reionization were correlated with their mass, by tracing their building-blocks back to the EOR. For $M_{z=0}$ between $10^{8}$ and $10^{13} M_\odot$, galaxies more massive than the MW were typically reionized earlier than the global mean, with a spread in reionization times for the building-blocks of a galaxy as large as galaxy-to-galaxy variations. This inhomogeneous timing of reionization amongst and within galaxies should be taken into account when modelling and interpreting stellar populations.  With CLUEs ICs, we modelled both global and LG reionization finding MW and M31 reionized earlier than the global mean, and mostly without influence from outside the LG or each other.

%These state-of-the-art results illustrate and quantify these important effects self-consistently for the first time.  

These results should be developed further in the future, as additional physical processes are included (e.g. possible AGN and X-ray binary sources, He and $H_2$ chemistry, metallicity evolution), limitations of numerical mass resolution and box size are overcome, and CLUEs ICs are improved by increased knowledge of the observed local universe.  


%We combined for the first time the results of an AMR radiative hydrodynamics simulation of the Reionization to a z=0 DM simulation. We find that halos with $M_{z=0}$ between $10^{8}$ and $10^{13} M_\odot $ have a mass-dependent experience of the Reionization : for MW-like objects, it occurs $~150$ Myrs before the full volume with a $\sim \pm 100$ Myrs scatter. The Reionization duration within a halo can be as large as the halo-to-halo variation, implying that any modeling that includes the latter should include fluctuations of Reionization times within a galaxy for consistency. The LG reionized in isolation and within the LG, the MW and M31 ionized bubbles don't seem to overlap. Compared to the global population of galaxies, the MW and M31 experienced a slightly late and shorter reionization. 
 
%Our results complement investigations made by e.g. \citet{WEI07}, \citet{ALV9}, \citet{LI14} and \citet{OCV14}, by combining for the first time an AMR fully consistent radiative transfer simulation of the Reionization and a z=0 N-Body tree-code simulation. 

%In \citet{OCV14}, sub-haloes of M31 and MW analogs display a radial gradient of reionization redshift in their z=0 distribution : noting that our data display a similar spatial resolution, the statistics of such gradients in a population of MW-Like objects can be studied.  They would depend on the environment of halos, as implied by the wide variety of Reionization durations and by the comparisons between sub-volumes : further investigations are under way. 
%More generally, the current study underlines further that the halo mass alone is not sufficient to constrain the reionization past of an object.

%Our choices can impact our predictions. The resolution achieved here could only be obtained on moderate cosmological volumes, compared to e.g. \citet{LI14}. Such volumes are known to limit the representativity of HII regions sizes (see e.g. \citet{ILI6}) and underestimate the spatial fluctuation levels of Reionization fields. 
%Also, our initial conditions were designed to produce analogs of Local clusters~: our Reionization is therefore unlikely to be fully representative of the transition experienced by a randomly selected 64 Mpc volume . 
% The residual z=6 neutral fraction  is too low compared to Ly-$\alpha$ constraints, as also measured in the CODA I and an updated CODA II simulation (Ocvirk et al. 2014, Ocvirk et al. in prep). It could be due to an excess of radiation produced by the local overabundance of clusters, also explaining the earlier Reionization times found here for MW-like objects compared to Alvarez et al. 2009 and Li et al. 2014.

%The CODA I-AMR and CoDa I-DM2048 simulations and their combination are the result of a long-term development strategy and challenging productions runs. Taken in conjunction with previous works, our results establish further the picture of an early, diverse and not instantaneous Reionization as seen by galaxies. 

%The models can be improved. For example, the inclusion of AGNs would lead to another sources of environmental fluctuations (see e.g. \citet{CHA15}), whereas models for star formation driven e.g. by molecular or metal cooling (see e.g. \citet{WIS9}) could modify the source halo mass-dependence of photon production among the halo classes. Likewise the volumes probed here are known to limit the representativity of H II region sizes (see e.g. \citet{ILI6}) and underestimate the spatial fluctuations levels of reionization fields.  Also, the LG members reionized in isolation but it can be tested further using updated sets of constrained ICs (e.g. \cite{CARL17}). These effects can modify our quantitative predictions, but we don't expect them to alter substantially our predictions. 

%Future investigations will include the environmental dependence of our results, as we expect field galaxies to experience reionization differently from members of groups or clusters. We also aim to investigate the detailed structure of reionization within haloes, with a focus on the impact on LG satellites.


%Hopefully, this letter will act as a solid building block for these forthcoming studies based on the CODA~I-AMR run.


%On the other hand, this work %in conjunction to previous ones 
%establishes further the diverse view of the Reionization as seen by galaxies~: 


%\begin{itemize}
%\item Limitations of the model : resolution, volume limitations, no AGN, H2, metals,etc..
%\item How does it compares to Alvarez et al. 09 and Li et al. 2014 (Method) ? The current volume is much smaller and our resolution is much higher than these previous studies : as a consequence the range of halo mass probed here is much more consistent with galactic scales. We use actual coupled radiative hydrodynamics simulation instead of semi-numerical models. We use z=6 positions to assign Reionization redshifts instead of z=0 ones, which I think is much more representative of the actual Reionization history : note that since we are investigating halos with lower masses, their peculiar motion is likely higher and using their z=0 positions is likely to be a very poor approximation of their location at high-z. In fact, that's how it has been done at first and the trends are almost completely washed out. 
%\item How does it compares to Alvarez et al. 09 and Li et al. 2014 (Results) ? They are consistent with a slight tendency to have higher Reionization redshifts in our case in the range of mass that overlaps : typically they find a $\Delta z\sim 1 \pm 1$ for $M\sim10^{12} M_\odot$ while here we have $\Delta z\sim 2.5 \pm 2$. It could be explained by different methodologies (z=0 vs z=6 position for instance) or population statistics (their boxes are larger but less resolved). In terms of intrinsic scatter $\Delta t$, the results are fully consistent but the scatter are quite large, both in ours and theirs studies.
